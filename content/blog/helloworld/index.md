최근 웹 프로그래밍 공부를 시작하고 배워야하는 언어들과 그 양에 조금 지쳐있었다.




This is my very first post on my new blog!

Recently, I started studying web programming in a class.

It feels little overwhelmed with all of the programming languages and the depth of them.

Writing down what I learned on my blog will be a great method to study for myself and hopefully to others as well.

Here's a list of languages I learned (+and will learn) from the class. 

> - Java 
> - Oracle
> - HTML/CSS/JS
> - Servlet/JSP
> - git
> + Spring, Spring Boot

And the languages I'd like to study alone after the course.

> - MyBatis
> - MySql
> - JPA/Hibernate

I realized I need to fully understand at least one language to learn another one. 

So, the next posts will be about the basic principles about Java.
